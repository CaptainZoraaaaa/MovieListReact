# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Enable Running The App 

- To start the app Node.js and PNPM is needed 

- To install pnpm you can can use for example npm which can be found at: https://www.npmjs.com/ (tips npm comes with Node.js)  

- To install pnpm you can use the following command: npm install -g pnpm

- After PNPM is installed move to the root folder and run: pnpm install Or Pnpm i

- From the projects root folder run the command: PNPM dev Or PNPM run dev 

- Vite will then host the app on localhost.
